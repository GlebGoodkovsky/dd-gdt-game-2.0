# Godot Rock Tunnels

---

Simple Godot game designed by Gleb Goodkovsky and Nadia Sobrepena during the BCIT Daydream Hackathon event. This is our first game designed on Godot. It was a great learning experience experimenting with the fundamentals of the game engine.  A simple game that involves controlling the character to navigate around various tunnels.
